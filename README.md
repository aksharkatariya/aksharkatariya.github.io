### Transit and Food Availability in Ashburn, Chicago

### Philanthropy and Responsibilism in the United States
**Description:** This project was funded in a pitch contest hosted by Professor Thomas Talhelm at Booth School of Business. This gave us an opportunity to design our own survey of more than 50 questions which was completed by 180 individuals in the United States. This project explored giving patterns in the U.S., analyzing factors influencing donations, preferences for structured vs. informal giving, and donor anxieties. Findings provided insights into philanthropic behavior and the motivations driving charitable contributions. We used Qualtrics & R to collect and analyze data.

### Materiality Assessment of APA Corp. (2024)

### What in the F-gases?
**Description:** This project utilized Altair in python to create interactive visualizations exploring fluorinated gas (F-gases) emissions across countries, development statuses, and industries. Key insights included identifying the top 10 emitters, analyzing per capita emissions trends, and highlighting the role of retail refrigeration in rising emissions. The visual narratives effectively communicated the disparity in emissions and the need for targeted mitigation policies using relevant graphs & color themes.

### Reading Beyond the (Radcliffe) Line: Sentiment Analysis & NER on Partition-Era Books
**Description:** This project used sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER) in R to explore evidence of syncretism and related rhetoric in five well-known books that provide a narrative account of the Partition. The goal was to analyze the sentiment and identify key entities related to the partition's themes and discourse.

### HabitByBit: SMS-based Habit Tracking App
**Description:** Using Ruby on Rails and D3.js, I developed an SMS-based habit tracker designed for ease of use and seamless customization. The application enables users to self-report habits via text messages, offering a simple yet effective way to track progress.
